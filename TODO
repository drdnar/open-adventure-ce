The FORTRANish mess that once was is now mostly idiomatic C. Some issues
remain to be cleaned up:

* The program is still pretty much typeless. Some attempt has been
  made to introduce semantic types, but the job is barely started.

* More possible vase tests: FILL VASE while it's on the ground next to you;
  DROP VASE in the Soft Room; DROP VASE in the well house and confirm
  that you do/don't get points for it; die while carrying the vase and
  confirm that it doesn't break.

We are aware that the lamp currently used as the project logo is a
hurricane lamp, not a proper miner's lamp. Submissions of potential
replacement images would be welcome.
