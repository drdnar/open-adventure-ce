/*  Cave closing and scoring */


/*  These sections handle the closing of the cave.  The cave closes "clock1"
 *  turns after the last treasure has been located (including the pirate's
 *  chest, which may of course never show up).  Note that the treasures need not
 *  have been taken yet, just located.  Hence clock1 must be large enough to get
 *  out of the cave (it only ticks while inside the cave).  When it hits zero,
 *  we branch to 10000 to start closing the cave, and then sit back and wait for
 *  him to try to get out.  If he doesn't within clock2 turns, we close the
 *  cave; if he does try, we assume he panics, and give him a few additional
 *  turns to get frantic before we close.  When clock2 hits zero, we branch to
 *  11000 to transport him into the final puzzle.  Note that the puzzle depends
 *  upon all sorts of random things.  For instance, there must be no water or
 *  oil, since there are beanstalks which we don't want to be able to water,
 *  since the code can't handle it.  Also, we can have no keys, since there is a
 *  grate (having moved the fixed object!) there separating him from all the
 *  treasures.  Most of these problems arise from the use of negative prop
 *  numbers to suppress the object descriptions until he's actually moved the
 *  objects. */

 *  all the dwarves (and the pirate), remove the troll and bear (unless dead),
 *  and set "closng" to true.  Leave the dragon; too much trouble to move it.
 *  from now until clock2 runs out, he cannot unlock the grate, move to any
 *  location outside the cave, or create the bridge.  Nor can he be
 *  resurrected if he dies.  Note that the snake is already gone, since he got
 *  to the treasure accessible only via the hall of the mountain king. Also, he's
 *  been in giant room (to get eggs), so we can refer to it.  Also also, he's
