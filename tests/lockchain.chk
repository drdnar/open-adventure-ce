attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.

One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!

The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a
blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarf, who flees

of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.

The waters have parted to form a narrow path across the reservoir.

You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water
rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is
nearly deafening, and the mist is so thick you can barely see.

slim footholds which would enable you to climb up, but it looks
extremely dangerous.  Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains
of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it.

You are climbing along a nearly vertical cliff.

You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.

You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away
from the chasm into a winding corridor.

A rickety wooden bridge extends across the chasm, vanishing into the
mist.  A notice posted on the bridge reads, "Stop! Pay troll!"

A burly troll stands by the bridge and insists you throw him a
treasure before you may cross.

> attack

Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.

You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A notice
above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"

> unlock chain

I see no chain here.

> in

You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.

There is a ferocious cave bear eyeing you from the far end of the room!

The bear is locked to the wall with a golden chain!

With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??

> fork

The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.

> listen

The air is filled with a dull rumbling sound.

> go left

The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.

> north

You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.

> listen

The roaring is so loud that it drowns out all other sound.

> extinguish volcano

It is beyond your power to do that.

> s

You're at junction with warm walls.

> listen

> n

You're at breath-taking view.

> jump

There is now one more gruesome aspect to the spectacular vista.

Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
to try to reincarnate you?
