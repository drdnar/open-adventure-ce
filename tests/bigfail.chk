overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.

covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

from the chasm into a winding corridor.

A rickety wooden bridge extends across the chasm, vanishing into the

You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.

There is a ferocious cave bear eyeing you from the far end of the room!

The bear is locked to the wall with a golden chain!

down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.

The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.

a low rumbling.

Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
stumble back and fall into the chasm.

Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
to try to reincarnate you?
