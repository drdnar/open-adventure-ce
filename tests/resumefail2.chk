You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully.

Can't open file y, try again.

I'm sorry, but that Adventure was begun using Version -133.-7 of the
save file format, and this program uses Version 2.9.  You must find an instance
using that other version in order to resume that Adventure.

You're in front of building.


You scored 32 out of a possible 430, using 1 turn.

You are obviously a rank amateur.  Better luck next time.
