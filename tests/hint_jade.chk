You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.

> H'CFL

The waters have parted to form a narrow path across the reservoir.

You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water
rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is

slim footholds which would enable you to climb up, but it looks
extremely dangerous.  Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains
of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it.

You are climbing along a nearly vertical cliff.

You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.

wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.

There is an enormous clam here with its shell tightly closed.
