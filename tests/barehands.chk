You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist

staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.
